This code is not asyncronous however it runs off of our async server which will be used to
try and implement a more asyncronous client loop. This "improved" implementation will be 
based off of a bare bone version of "PipeDream". However due to the fact that I am looking
for more model capacity through model parallelism PipeDream may not achieve these needs
due to its parallel/pipelined nature so I will also test out this "naive" implementation
of model parallelism.
